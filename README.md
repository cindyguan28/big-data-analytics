# Big Data Analytics

EEBDA big data analytics exercise project

## Case Study 1: Descriptive and diagnostic analytics

Auditing, detection of duplicates

* Data preperation: import, conversion, filter, merge
* Data analytics with Chisquare, p-value,
* Checking equal distribution and Benford distribution

## Case Study 2: Predictive Analytics with machine learning algorithms

Fraud and error detection using statistical methods of non-parametric classification.

* Machine Learning / Data Mining
* Classification algorithms:
  * K-nearest neighbors
  * Decision trees
  * Support-vector-machines
* training - predicting - evaluating

## Case Study 3: Predictive Analytics using Regression while Incorporating Heterogeneity

Business Valuation M&A by means of simple multiples

* Discounted Cash Flow model and valuation using multiples
* Regression analyses: SLR, MLR, SUR
